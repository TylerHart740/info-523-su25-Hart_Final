Several farmsteads saw significant damage between Sugar Lake and County Road 14, with a house and two barns completely destroyed. From this point the tornado continued to the north, growing to one mile in width. Around 1800 LST, a house and barn were destroyed approximately one mile west of Manchester on County Road 25, where extensive tree and structural damage was also noted at several properties in the area. Additionally, west of this tornadic damage, a separate area of tree and structural damage was caused by strong thunderstorm winds associated with a rear flank downdraft (see separate entry).||About one mile north, the tornado weakened slightly to EF-2 Intensity, where it damaged three full grain bins near County Road 29.

Eventually this storm moved across most of the Twin Cities metro area, with the most damage from northern Hennepin, through Ramsey and southern Washington.  ||The second storm followed a similar path from west central Minnesota, southeast to just north of the Minnesota River Valley, then across the southern part of the Twin Cities metro area. The two storms merged across southern Minnesota from near Faribault, northeast to Red Wing, and to near Eau Claire Wisconsin. This storm rapidly moved southeast and became a large bow echo that raced across southern Wisconsin, and northern Illinois by Wednesday morning.  ||The northern storm produced several measured wind gusts in excess of 70 mph across Wright, Hennepin, Ramsey and Washington counties. The worst damage which a storm survey estimated winds near 80 mph, produced a six mile long damage path of downed transmission lines near St. Michaels and Rogers. As the storms moved into the western metro area, there were numerous reports of downed trees and power lines, with measured severe wind gusts at both Crystal and Flying Cloud airports. The downtown St. Paul airport also measured a severe wind gust as the storms moved into Ramsey and into Washington county. The Maple Grove hospital had structural damage to their building. Pavers from an upper roof blew off and penetrated a roof below. This caused rain to seep into patient rooms and to the 1st floor imaging and PCC. ||There were some issues related to flooded roads in the Minneapolis, St. Paul metropolitan area, but most of the flooded roads were concentrated in poor drainage where rain water had no place to go.  ||The second and southern storm initially produced several large hail reports, up to 2 inches in diameter from Cosmos to Hutchinson. This storm began to bow out in the southwest suburbs of the Twin Cities near Jordon, Prior Lake and Burnsville and moved southeast. This storm produced two tornadoes, one east of  Faribault, and another west of Goodhue.||During the height of the storm, Xcel Energy reported more than 138,000 customers without power.",286

Visible tree damage from the tornado, estimated to have begun at 5:05 PM CDT, was first observed on the west side of US Highway 53 about 4.5 miles south of Cotton, MN, with pine trees snapped at the base. The tornado continued to move northeastward to uproot trees along Three Lakes Road about one-half mile east of the U.S. Highway 53 intersection. The storm began to move more north-northeastward so the tornado track shifted more northward with the most widespread surveyed damage seen along Bug Creek Road about 2.5 miles east-southeast of Cotton, MN. Over 50 pine trees and numerous clusters of aspen trees were observed to be snapped at the base and/or uprooted, estimated to have occurred at around 5:15 PM. A few still-standing pine trees had metal sheets lofted and wrapped around them. Minor to moderate structure damage was reported by two property owners along Bug Creek Road before the tornado passed northward over the Whiteface River. Towards 5:18 PM, the tornado began to weaken and finally lifted off the ground. The last uprooted trees, 4 aspen, were last observed at the intersection of Comstock Lake Road and Melrude Road, 2.7 miles east of Cotton, MN. In total, the tornado was on the ground for a total of 5.9 miles and for around 13 minutes. The damage rating from the NWS Duluth Storm Survey team resulted in an EF-1 rating with winds estimated at 105 mph. There were a total of two Tornado Warning in effect from 4:55 PM to 5:45 PM for this tornadic supercell thunderstorm.","A cold front moved through north-central Minnesota in the late afternoon hours on Thursday, September 19, 2024. Out ahead of the cold front in northeast Minnesota, discrete severe thunderstorms began to form in far northeast Minnesota along the US Hwy 53 corridor around 4 PM CT. The first Severe Thunderstorm Warning was issued at 4:15 PM for parts of far northeast St. Louis County and northwest Lake County as the severe storm moved northeastward around 30 mph. By 4:55 PM, conditions within a different severe supercell thunderstorm warranted the first Tornado Warning of the evening to be issued for central St. Louis County around the communities of Cotton and Canyon, MN. Between 5 and 5:30 PM that evening, multiple additional Severe Thunderstorm and Tornado Warnings were issued along and east of US Hwy 53 and along the I-35 corridor into east- central Minnesota. The cold front continued to move eastward through the early evening hours on the 19th, with storms beginning to enter Douglas and Burnett Counties in northwest Wisconsin towards 6 PM as low-level funnel clouds were reported by law enforcement and trained weather spotters. Hail up to 1.5 inches in diameter was reported from the strongest thunderstorms, but in very localized reports. As the air mass began to cool and stabilized in the mid-evening hours, the threat for additional tornadoes began to wane and the strongest thunderstorms were limited to the Twin Ports and across northwest Wisconsin. As the cold front entered northwest Wisconsin by late evening, activity subsided to only showers and general thunderstorms with no additional impacts reported overnight. In total, eight Tornado Warnings, nine Severe Thunderstorms Warnings and two Special Marine Warnings were issued for this severe weather event. The Cotton/Canyon Tornado is the only confirmed tornado from this severe weather event at this time. While funnel clouds were reported with several other storms, there is currently no evidence that any of the other storms produced a tornado that reached the ground and produced damage.",484
